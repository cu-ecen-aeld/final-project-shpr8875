# Climate Change Monitoring System

## Project Overview
- https://github.com/cu-ecen-aeld/final-project-shpr8875/wiki

### Project Goals:
- Efficiently monitor environmental conditions (temperature and humidity).
- Communicate sensor data between devices over MQTT.
- Display real-time sensor data on UART on the second Raspberry Pi.
- Use Yocto to create a customized build for the Raspberry Pi 3B platform.

## Source Code Organization
- The **Yocto build environment** will be hosted at [Yocto-Climate-Change-Monitoring-Repo](cu-ecen-aeld/final-project-Induja21).
- The **MQTT communication and sensor data processing code** will be hosted in a separate repository at [Climate-Monitoring-App](https://github.com/cu-ecen-aeld/final-project-shpr8875).
